# Mst.BlogBuilder
This is a fork of the [Fritz.StaticWeb](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.StaticWeb) repository.
Features made here might be altered to support the Subathon Tool blog, but some changes might be useful for others.

A simple static blog generator built to support the Subathon Tool blog. 

It's built as a command-line tool that can run against a folder of templates and blog posts in markdown format. 

The eventual goal is that this repository generates a GitHub action that will be used to generate the KlipTok blog in that repository
